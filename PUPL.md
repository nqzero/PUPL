# PUPL - Payed Use Permissive License

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense,  and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

- The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software
- and you agree to the terms of this agreement:


### The Agreement
- you agree to acquire a use-license from the copyright owner for production use
- permission to use this software for other purposes is hereby granted
- you agree to present to a potential recipient of a distribution the above copyright notice and these license terms

if a work that you distribute, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the software or any part thereof, is accompanied by the complete corresponding source code or an equivalent offer of such, licensed under either:
 - this license, at no additional per-use cost
 - an OSI-approved open source license

then use-license responsibilities may be left solely to the recipient, who may apply any use-license or equivalent (including those acquired at zero cost) to satisfy their use-license requirements.
otherwise, you agree to acquire on the recipients behalf, or verify they possess, an applicable use-license



### Definitions:
- production: used for the sake of the data or processing
- per-annum: use of 1 core for 1 year
- lifetime: use of 1 core for the term of the copyright

### Assurances:
the copyright owner agrees:
- to specify a fixed strike price which the per-annum full price will never exceed
- to publish per-annum and lifetime full prices, subject to monthly changes
- to issue use-licenses purchasable at full price (per-annum and lifetime) that will:
    - be transferable
    - be renewable (for per-annum, even with lapses) at that original price each year
    - without lapses, entitle purchase and renewal of 4 additional units at that original price
    - for purchases of the latest version, apply to any version released within 1 year of original purchase or older
    - credit the greater of the current or the paid price of your version towards upgrade to a future version
- to allow all use-licenses purchased at non-zero-cost to be applied to use of either the original work or any derivative work, though derivative works may add additional restrictions

in the event that the copyright owner is unable to issue or fails in a timely manner to issue a use-license consistent with these terms at your request and attempted payment, you are granted non-transferable permission to use this software on any number of cores for any purpose for 1 year,
and, if you place full non-zero payment in escrow, all the rights you would have been entitled to had the use-licenses been issued

if this non-issue condition persists for 2 consecutive years, during which you make reasonable unsuccessful attempts to acquire use-licenses, or the software is publicly abandoned, you are granted a license to the software under the terms of the MIT license

you accept that you are entitled to no other relief if the copyright owner is unable to or chooses not to issue use-licenses consistent with these terms

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.
